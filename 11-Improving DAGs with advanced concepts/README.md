# Minimising Repetitive Patterns With SubDAGs

How to make yourdagscleaner

# USE Case

![](img/11-Improving%20DAGs%20with%20advanced%20concepts1.png)

# Use Case

WithSubDags:

Tasks are grouped into the two boxes with bold borders\.

# How to create SubDAG?

![](img/11-Improving%20DAGs%20with%20advanced%20concepts3.png)

# Important Notes

The main DAG manages all thesubDAGsas normal tasks\.

Airflow UI only shows the main DAG\.

SubDagsmust be scheduled the same as their parent DAG\.

UseSubDagswith caution

# Making different paths in your DAGs with Branching

Choose the right path

# Use Case

LET'S start from a use case\.\.\.

# Definition

Branching is the mechanism allowing your DAG to choose between different paths according to the result of a specific task =BranchPythonOperator\.

# How Does It Work?

# Depends_on_past and Branching

You can usedepends\_on\_pastwith branching in your tasks
